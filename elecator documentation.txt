This is a basic python program to simulate a lift operation for a builiding of 10 floors
- It can detect if you entered a wrong floor which doesnt exist
- It can show you step by step on which floor sequentially either up or down like an animation in the lift showing the arrow
- It can detect if you have already entered a same floor again and let you try again
- It also remebers the floor and when used again it tries to count from the same floor

Limitations: 
- It is not scalable to user defined floors
